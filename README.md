# Tomb in My Heart

This application is a ***electric tomb***. Some virtual characters dead in their worlds. Many people love them even though
we are not in the same world. These virtual characters never really exist, so they don't have real tombs in real world.
However, some people still miss them. They may want to visit these characters' tombs. They may want to play some music
at their tombs, put some flowers on their tombs, write some letters to these characters and burn these letters at their
tombs, put some wines at the tombs, or just visit and sit there to accompany them. That's what this application want to
do. These people who miss ***virtual characters*** can use it. I once fell in love with two virtual characters, and they
both dead in their world. I want to visit their tomb and play my favourite piano piece to them, and leave a small blue
flower there. That's why I want to make these project.
